Today's question was posted on Slack yesterday by [Stephan](https://github.com/osterburg)

**Question:**

Write a function `solution(A, K)` where, given a list of numbers and a number K, return whether any two numbers from list add up to K.

For Example: Given the array A = [10, 15, 3, 7], and K = 17, `solution(A, K)` should return `TRUE`, since 10 + 7 = 17

**BONUS:** Can you do this in one pass?
